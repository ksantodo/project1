Load and transform the data for the analysis

#
# write a function geteloaddatadf() - you will assign the return value to eloaddf
# in the function do the following
# 1. load the electric load data from elecloaddata.xlsx
# you are not allowed to convert to .csv. Find an appropriate R package that can read .xlsx files and load
# the data in a dataframe called eloaddf. The columns should be dates, kwh, kwVAR
#
# some notes on the data
# the file has 15 min interval data from 1/1/2014 to 12/30/2015
# when you import the data, the first column of your dataset should be dates in POSIXct format
# HINT: use the strptime and as.POSIX.ct functions to form the eloaddf$dates

# write a funcion getbillsdf() - you will assign the return value to billsdf
# 3. Next load the bill data from billdata.xlsx

getbillsdf = function()

  data = read.xlsx("billdata.xlsx")
  
  names(data) = c("billdate", "billstartdt", "billenddt", "kwh", "mindemandkw", "actualdemandkw", 
                  "custcharge", "distchrgkw", "mttkwh", "tbckwh", "nugckwh", "sbckwh", "rggieekwh", 
                  "deliverykwh", "totdeliverychrg", "supplychrg", "totalchrg");
  
  data$billdate = convertToDate(data$billdate, origin = "1900-01-01");
  data$billstartdt = convertToDate(data$billstartdt, origin = "1900-01-01");
  data$billenddt = convertToDate(data$billenddt, origin = "1900-01-01");
  
  return(data)
}

billsdf = getbillsdf();

```

We now have 3 data sets

1. Electric load data in 15 min interval
2. Weather data in 60 min interval
3. Bill data monthly

Lets do some simple analysis

Display the monthly load profile

```{r}
# display a summary of the electric load data eloaddf$kwh by summarizing it by year, month and total kwh over each month
# your answer should display 24 rows without the header.

month.year = format(eloaddf$dates, "%Y %m");
total.kwh = aggregate(eloaddf$kwh, list(month.year), sum);

names(total.kwh) = c("Year/Month", "Total kWh");
print(total.kwh, row.names = F);

```

Now let us do some plotting of the load data

```{r}
# form a dataframe called eloadhrdf with two columns dates, kwh
# this dataframe sums the 15min kwh in the eloaddf to hourly data
# next create a plot frame with two panels side by side
# On the left panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2014 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame
# On the right panel show a heat map of kwh data for 2015 with x-axis as months and y-axis as hour of the day (1 to 24). use subsetting of the data frame rather than copying the data into yet another data frame

# substract 1 to move the 24:00 time to previous hour
hour=cut(as.POSIXct(eloaddf$dates-1), "hour");

eloadhrdf = aggregate(eloaddf$kwh, list(hour), sum);
names(eloadhrdf) = c("dates", "kwh");

eloadhrdf$dates = as.POSIXct(strptime(eloadhrdf$dates, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), tz = "GMT");

# install ggplot2 for heat map
library(ggplot2)

idx.14 = which(format(eloadhrdf$dates, "%Y") == "2014")

gg14 = ggplot(data = eloadhrdf[idx.14, ], aes(x = format(dates, "%m"), y = format(dates, "%H"), fill = kwh)) + geom_tile() + xlab("Month") + ylab("Hour");

gg15 = ggplot(data = eloadhrdf[-idx.14, ], aes(x = format(dates, "%m"), y = format(dates, "%H"), fill = kwh)) + geom_tile() + xlab("Month") + ylab("Hour");

library(grid)
library(gridExtra)

grid.arrange(gg14, gg15, ncol = 2)

```
The heat maps are closely identical except for the early hours of April and August which seemed to have low kWh is 2014.  Although overall, 2015 has a higher range and therefore used more power in that year.

We plot the weather data using boxplot to explore the variation in temperature graphically

```{r}
# plot the weather data. Use boxplots in ggplot2 with month on the x-axis and temperature in y-axis

bp = ggplot(data = weatherdf, aes(x = format(weatherdf$dates, "%m"), y = TEMP)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Month") + ylab("Temperature")

bp

```

We are now ready to build a simple predictive model.

```{r}
#create a dataframe with hourly interval data inside your function by 
# combining selective columns from eloadhrdf and weatherdf
# your dataframe should be called modeldatadf and the columns should be dates, year, month, hrofday, temp, kwh
#
hour=cut(as.POSIXct(weatherdf$dates), "hour");
hour = as.POSIXct(hour, tz = "GMT");
idx = which(!duplicated(hour) & format(weatherdf$dates, "%Y") != 2016);

# inner join
modeldatadf = merge(data.frame(dates = eloadhrdf$dates, kwh = eloadhrdf$kwh), data.frame(dates = hour[idx], temp = weatherdf$TEMP[idx]));

modeldatadf$year = as.factor(format(modeldatadf$dates, "%Y"));
modeldatadf$month = as.factor(format(modeldatadf$dates, "%m"));
modeldatadf$hrofday = as.factor(format(modeldatadf$dates, "%H"));

modeldatadf = modeldatadf[c(1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2)];

#
# write a simple function called predmodel. the model object should be the return parameter
# pass in the appropriate data frames.
# 
# you should fit a GLM with the following specification kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp
# your model should only use 2014 data for your prediction model
#
# use the summary function and display the results of the function

# use default gaussian family
premodel = function(data)
{
  glm.fit = glm(kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp, data = data, subset = year == 2014);
  
  return(glm.fit)
}

model.2014 = premodel(modeldatadf);
summary(model.2014)

```

In the year 2014 it seems that the model used the month of January and first hour of the day as the intercepts.

There is a decline in kwh in march and a steady increase after.  There is a sharp increase in October and sharply drops after.  This is obviously caused by changing of the seasons.

In terms of hour of the day, the amount of kwh declines up until the 5th hour and then usage increases.  It increase until hour 16 and declines again. This is probably due to less energy being used during hours of sleep and increases during the hours of the daylight.  The hours of the day are probably due to air conditioning, and day to day technology being used.

Now show you skills in Machine Learning!

```{r}
#
# use the dataframe modeldatadf
# split it into training and testing data sets based on 2014 data for training and 2015 data for testing
# Use the GBM algorithm in the caret package in R to train and validate the model.
# You have free reign to display and explain your results graphically
#
#

library(gbm)
idx = which(modeldatadf$year == 2014);
train = modeldatadf[idx, 3:6];

# address of office
set.seed(6814);

gbm.fit = gbm(kwh ~ month + hrofday + temp, data = train, distribution = "gaussian", shrinkage = 0.01, interaction.dept = 2, var.monotone = c(0, 0, 1), n.trees = 3000, cv.folds = 10, verbose = T)

best.iter_train = gbm.perf(gbm.fit, method = "cv")
summary(gbm.fit)
gbm.fit$cv.error[best.iter_train]
gbm.fit$train.error[best.iter_train]
plot(x = gbm.fit, i.var = "hrofday", n.trees = best.iter_train)
plot(x = gbm.fit, i.var = "month", n.trees = best.iter_train)
plot(x = gbm.fit, i.var = "temp", n.trees = best.iter_train)

```
Lets now compare the predicted model for 2015 with the bill data kwh!

```{r}
#
# run your machine learning model and create a data frame of dates, kwh for 1hr interval data for 2015. note you
# may need to include the last few days of 2014 in your dataset due to the billing dates in January (see billdata.xlsx)
# call your data frame pred2015df.

idx = which(modeldatadf$dates >= as.POSIXct("2014-12-20 0:00:00 GMT", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "GMT"));

pred2015df = modeldatadf[idx, ];

# now for each of the 12 rows (billing periods) in the billsdf, sum the kwh for the date range in each of the rows from pred2015df for the corresponding start and end of billing in billsdf

predkwh = predict(gbm.fit, pred2015df, type = "response", n.trees = best.iter_train);

# create a resultsdf which has billdate, predkwh (from pred2015df), actualkwh (from billsdf)

resultsdf = data.frame(dates = billsdf$billdate, predkwh = integer(12), actualkwh = billsdf$kwh);

idx = which(pred2015df$dates < as.POSIXct(billsdf$billstartdt[2]));
resultsdf$predkwh[1] = sum(pred2015df$kwh[idx])

for (i in 2:11)
{
  idx = which(pred2015df$dates >= as.POSIXct(billsdf$billstartdt[i]) & 
              pred2015df$dates < as.POSIXct(billsdf$billstartdt[i+1]))
    resultsdf$predkwh[i] = sum(pred2015df$kwh[idx])  
}

idx = which(pred2015df$dates >= as.POSIXct(billsdf$billstartdt[12]));
resultsdf$predkwh[12] = sum(pred2015df$kwh[idx])

resultsdf
# display the results
```

This completes this little exploration of energy load data. Thank You!
